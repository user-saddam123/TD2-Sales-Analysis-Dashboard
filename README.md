## Insights:

 * #### Sales by Month | with slicer Curent Year and Previous Year:
Utilizing a line chart, I've visualized product category sales over each month of the current year (CY) and PY Previous year by one slicer. This graphical representation offers a clear view of the sales trends by month.


 * #### Order by Segment:
A donut chart has been employed to illustrate the distribution of orders across different segments. This visualization enables a quick assessment of order volumes by segment.

 * #### Sales by Region:
A bar column chart has been utilized to showcase sales region. This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different regions.

 * #### Sales by Month | Segment

I used a column chart to easily visualize the sales by month and segment, clearly showing the sales figures for each segment in each month.

The analysis reveals that the consumer segment experienced the highest sales in September, whereas the corporate segment saw its peak in November.

 * #### Category Ranking:
To offer insights into category performance, a table has been created displaying customer names alongside the order of categories based on month and year. This allows stakeholders to identify the top-performing categories over specific periods.
